### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pasquale Palombo and ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my videogame Mi.m.i.c.
Mi.m.i.c. is an action roguelike with dungeon crawler elements. Players control a Mimic, exploring randomly generated levels and protect them by the incoming heroes, fighting enemies, and collecting power-ups. The game offers high replayability with numerous items, bosses, and curious events.
